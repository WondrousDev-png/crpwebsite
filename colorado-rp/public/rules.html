                    <br>
                    <strong>5. Profanity:</strong> Please respect the community’s filter and refrain from bypassing it. Use of excessive profanity is discouraged, and racial slurs will not be tolerated under any circumstance.

                    <br>
                    <strong>7. Server Drama:</strong> Creating or engaging in drama, or showing disrespect toward other communities, is prohibited. If you need to discuss any such matters, please handle them via direct messages.
                    <br>

                    <strong>1. Realism:</strong> Everything in our server should be as realistic as possible. Avoid using unrealistic avatars or driving erratically. Always roleplay your crashes and accidents with appropriate responses.
                    <br>
                    <strong>2. Random Deathmatch (RDM):</strong> Random Deathmatching is strictly prohibited. Always ensure you have a valid reason for shooting or attacking someone.
                    <br>
                    <strong>3. Vehicle Deathmatch (VDM):</strong> Vehicle Deathmatching is not allowed. You must have a legitimate reason to crash into someone’s vehicle.
                    <br>
                    <strong>4. Roleplaying Death:</strong> Upon death, you must assume the role of a completely new character. Do not carry over any knowledge or memories from your previous life.
                    <br>
                    <strong>5. Fear for Your Life:</strong> When your life is threatened, such as when a weapon is pointed at you, you must act as though you fear for your life. You cannot draw a weapon if one is already aimed at you.
                    <br>
                    <strong>6. Arresting Procedures:</strong> When arresting a player, you must clearly indicate you are pulling out handcuffs (e.g., not running while cuffing). You cannot simply run up and cuff someone without proper roleplay for the detainment.
                    <br>
                    <strong>7. Robbery Requirements:</strong> To rob the Jewelry Store or Colorado Bank, you must have at least two or more players involved in the robbery.

                    <strong>1. Law Enforcement Driving:</strong> As a member of law enforcement, you must drive responsibly. Reckless driving is prohibited, and you may only break city laws when your sirens and lights are active.
                    <br>
                    <strong>2. Colorado State Patrol:</strong> The Colorado State Patrol is a whitelisted department, meaning you must apply to join. The use of supervisor, undercover, or ghost liveries is restricted to authorized members only.
                    <br>
                    <strong>3. Hostage Situations:</strong> If a suspect is holding a hostage, you cannot rush into the situation and immediately eliminate the suspect. Roleplay the scenario realistically and take appropriate action.
                    <br>
                    <strong>4. Jurisdiction Rules:</strong> Jurisdiction is important: Denver Police must stay within city limits, Jefferson County Sheriff Office must remain in the county, and the Colorado State Patrol may patrol the entire map. You can exceed your jurisdiction for high-risk calls or pursuits.
                    <br>
                    <strong>5. Supervisor and Staff Oversight:</strong> Supervisors can request your removal from the team if you are not roleplaying correctly or acting unrealistically as an LEO. Staff members also have the authority to remove you if necessary.
